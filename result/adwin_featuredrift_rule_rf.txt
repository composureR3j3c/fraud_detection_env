That‚Äôs a solid result! Here's what stands out from your final evaluation:

üìä Performance Summary:

Accuracy: 99.86%

Fraud class (1) detection:

Precision: 86.1% ‚Üí When it predicted fraud, it was correct most of the time.

Recall: 44.9% ‚Üí It missed more than half of the actual frauds.

F1-score: 59.05% ‚Üí Reflects the trade-off between precision and recall.

Normal class (0) was predicted extremely accurately (almost 100%).

üìà Drift Detection:

Drift points detected: 100+ across the 30,000 streamed samples

Rule-based mode triggered: 103 times

Most drift detections seem to cluster tightly in the later chunks ‚Üí suggesting the simulation or feature shift in those areas was effective.

The rule-based fallback seems to be working selectively and sparingly.

üîç Observations & Suggestions:

Concept Drift Sensitivity:

The dual detection method (ADWIN + feature-based) is performing better, though you may still want to fine-tune the feature_threshold or ADWIN‚Äôs delta to reduce over-triggering in low-impact cases.

Recall Challenge for Class 1:

44.9% recall on frauds is an improvement but still suggests the model is cautious.

Possible improvements:

Use cost-sensitive training to penalize fraud misclassifications more.

Try a streaming ensemble or an online learner like Hoeffding Tree if you revisit dynamic retraining.

Rule Triggering:

103 rule-based predictions (out of 30,000) is modest, which is good. But you can log how many of those were correct to evaluate its utility more explicitly.

Latency:

If you‚Äôre still tracking average and max inference latency, how did those look? Consistent low latency is a huge win in stream processing setups.

Would you like help:

Fine-tuning the drift thresholds or fallback logic?

Improving fraud recall further?

Adding logs to analyze rule-based prediction performance in detail?

Happy to help push it forward!
